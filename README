I use the HandBrake application (https://github.com/HandBrake) at my day job ripping in-house videos from DVD to various other file formats (yes, it's all legal). In HandBrake, if you want to trim the amount of time spent ripping a clip, you can specify an entry and exit point on the timeline.

However, HandBrake lists the points as seconds. That's where this little calculator comes in handy. Granted, you could do this with a calculator and some paper and pencil (perhaps minus the paper and pencil), but what fun is that?

#### Steps for use: ####
1. Make sure you have Ruby installed.
2. CD to the directory with the handbrakecalc.rb and run it in the Ruby shell.
3. Follow prompts.
